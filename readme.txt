Break-Out! - by Simon Price

To download loads more VB games, visit my website : www.hispalace.fsbusiness.co.uk

The aim of the game:

To score points by blowing up boxes. This can be done in several ways:
1/By hitting them
2/By setting off bombs to create a chain reaction of exploding boxes
3/By hitting a detonation button which will set off all the bombs at once!

Game Over:

You have to juggle more and more balls as they appear, and you cn drop as many balls as you like, as long as at least one is left in the air. When there are no more balls in the air, it's game over!

Controls:

Move the bat : Use the mouse
Resize the bat (to adjust difficulty) : Up and down arrow keys
Restart the game : R
Quit : Escape key
Turn SoundFX On/Off : S
Save a picture of the game : C - the pic will be saved in the folder 'Pictures' which is in the folder 'Resources'

How it all works:

Read the module 'BreakOut.bas' for info on how the game works.

Boring Copywrite Stuff

The game BreakOut and all related source code and graphics (but not the sound) are copywrite of King Si's Games TM and if you include any code from the game in your own program then please incude my name in the credits (maybe even with my website address). Blah..blah...this game is freeware or sfareware if I knew what that meant, but basically I mean do what, you like with it, send it to anyone as long as you keep all of it together (i.e. with this readme file). Blah, blah... oh, yeah - This game is not guaranteed to be error-free and any damage / loss of work / whatever that occurs as a result of you running this program is not my problem.
